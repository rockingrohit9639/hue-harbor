To use your palettes in your projects using CDN you can use any one of the following methods.

1. Using website id

- Make sure you have website id with you, then include the following tag inside <head> of your html document

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hue-harbor.imrohitsaini.in/api/cdn/website/<YOUR-WEBSITE-ID>" />
```

2. Using palette slug

- Make sure you have slug of your palette with you. Then add the following html

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://hue-harbor.imrohitsaini.in/api/cdn/palette/<YOUR-PALETTE-SLUG>" />
```

\*_**Note**_ You can use CDN for PUBLIC palettes only

### Using APIs

We have created few APIs to meet your needs. If you are using any framework which supports hooks then you can create a hook like below in your project and can use accordingly.

```ts
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react'

type UseHueHarborProps = {
  apiKey: string // you can create and get API key from your dashboard
  paletteSlug: string
}

/**
 * This hook will fetch and insert all css variables from a palette
 * into your DOM :root
 */
type Response = {
  message: string
  data: Array<{ variableName: string; value: string }>
}

export default function useHueHarbor({ apiKey, paletteSlug }: UseHueHarborProps) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState('')
  const [variables, setVariables] = useState<Response['data']>([])

  const fetchAndUpdateCSS = useCallback(() => {
    setIsLoading(true)
    fetch(`https://hue-harbor.imrohitsaini.in/api/cdn/raw/${paletteSlug}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      },
    })
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((res: Response) => {
        res.data.forEach((variable) => {
          document.body.style.setProperty(variable.variableName, variable.value)
        })

        setVariables(res.data)
      })
      .catch(() => {
        setError('Something went wrong!')
      })
      .finally(() => {
        setIsLoading(false)
      })
  }, [apiKey, paletteSlug])

  useEffect(
    function fetchVariables() {
      fetchAndUpdateCSS()
    },
    [fetchAndUpdateCSS],
  )
